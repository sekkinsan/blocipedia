##Explanation
Much like it's wikipedia counterpart, Jiki is a basic CRUD application created using Ruby on Rails, where users are able to collaborate on community-sourced content. Whether or not it's for a project or just a hobby, users are able to create their own wikis and share them publicly or privately. Jiki was my second project using Ruby on Rails, and helped my grasp core concepts of CRUD.

##Problem
Initially I thought to myself it couldn't be too bad to set up the basic CRUD with basic functions, with the knowledge I have of wikis since I'm a user of some fan-made ones, but there was quite an eye-opening moment. From the get-go, I wasn't able to create the basic CRUD functions without running into any errors. A very difficult part in this project for me while developing was implementing new gems without any guidance that did make me feel lost quite often, as well as making the functions in specific views work properly.

##Solution
It was this project that made me truly begin to feel like I'm on a path to becoming a developer. Constant efforts of trial and error filled with googling specific errors, searching stackoverflow for even a tiny amount of guidance of anything related, all contributed to my ability to complete this project. In the end, I was able to get a basic layout after some research, and patched up my views to show properly which
was a result of trial and error with new paths I created throughout the course of this project.

##Results
Overall, Jiki had the basic structure and layout of what I had envisioned it to be! It was a great learning experience for me on basic web development, especially the concept of a CRUD application, which can essentially be used in many web applications.
